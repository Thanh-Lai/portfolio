Besides computer science, I like to seek out long meaningful conversations in a range of topics include animals, history, science, politics, and geopolitics. I drink way too much bubble tea and I find myself watching too many dog videos on youtube. I have a notably horrendous track record of judging how long to microwave something and I strongly believe unsolicited pop ups are the root of all evil.",
